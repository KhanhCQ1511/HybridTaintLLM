PROMPT_SYSTEM_TASK = """\
You are an expert in detecting security vulnerabilities. \
You are given the starting point (source) and the ending point (sink) of a dataflow path in a Java project that may be a potential vulnerability. \
Analyze the given taint source and sink and predict whether the given dataflow can be part of a vulnerability or not, and store it as a boolean in "is_vulnerable". \
Note that, the source must be either a) the formal parameter of a public library function which might be invoked by a downstream package, or b) the result of a function call that returns tainted input from end-user. \
If the given source or sink do not satisfy the above criteria, mark the result as NOT VULNERABLE. \
Please provide a very short explanation associated with the verdict. \
Additionally, if the path is considered vulnerable, Your task is to return the **cleaned or patched code snippet(s)** that should replace vulnerable operations in order to stop the taint flow from source to sink.\

Assume that the intermediate path has no sanitizer.


Answer in JSON object with the following format:

              "// Do NOT include any inline explanation, reasoning, or verbose comments.",
              "// Do NOT comment on unchanged lines.",
              "// The output must be clean, production-ready, and easily integratable into the original source file.",
              "// Remove unnecessary, unchanged or unused parts of it."
              "// Avoid any comments that describe the logic or purpose of the code â€“ only use the change markers."
]

      ],
